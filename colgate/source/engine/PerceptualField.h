// The decision stage: how far each band should move, from where it stands in the
// spectrum at this moment.
//
// Each band's level is taken relative to the signal's total level, so absolute
// level plays no part. A band that stands above its immediate neighbourhood is
// pulled down and one that sits below it is lifted:
//
//     level_k = own L_k + near L_k(1)
//
// Recover and Tame read that through two different static curves, each with a soft
// knee at zero, and Tame moves further for the same level. Recover only ever acts
// above its own zero and Tame only below its own. Their zeros aren't the same across
// the spectrum, so in the bass the two can work on one band at once:
//
//     gain_k = recover * above (level_k + staticR_k) + tame * below (scale level_k + staticT_k)
//
// One broadband gain then holds the sum over the bands of power^0.35 constant. That
// is why Tame alone lifts the treble and Recover alone dips the mids.
//
// The form and every number in ModeTuning come from measuring reference renders
// (see docs/DESIGN.md). In them 50/50 is the sum of 50/0 and 0/50, to 0.13 dB at
// worst, which is what the sum above and the loudness rule give.
